**If you know it, show the Typescript you want to write**
What Typescript code do you want to write that would create the proper SQL you want?

```typescript
// the Typescript code you propose should work
```

**Expected behavior**
SQLa is a code generator that usually generates SQL so include what SQL you _want_ generated (even if you don't know the Typescript, you should be able to tell us what SQL you want). Include a full example of the SQL block.

```sql
--- the expected SQL goes here
```
